# The Iris Data Set

## What exactly is it?

As the name suggests, the Iris data set is a set of data. It is well known in computer science as an example data set to conduct analysis on. It was introduced by a British statistician and biologist by the name of Ronald Fisher all the way back in 1936. [^1]
There are three iris species in the data set Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of three iris species. For each sample, four features are recorded: the length and width of the sepals (the green leaf-like structures that protect the flower bud) and the length and width of the petals (the colorful parts of the flower). This was all new to me as I don't think I've ever actually seen an iris flower.
The data was collected by a man called Dr. Edgar Anderson in Canada. [^2]
